Question 3
Given an arbitrary sequence of numerical values, write a function that
"analyzes" the sequence by generating print outputs of:

number of elements
number of unique elements
the min
the max
the mean
the standard deviation
all the modes (if there are more than one)
the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles
For example, given this list of numbers:

data = [
    61, 35, 99, 100, 75, 94, 88, 14, 21, 39, 53, 25, 87, 84,
    81, 55, 86, 18, 69, 44, 16, 33, 66, 52, 70, 52, 95, 45,
    94, 35, 68, 70, 52, 53, 30, 87, 79, 51, 92, 72, 55, 40,
    15, 74, 86, 87, 91, 70, 45, 37
]
For calculations that result in floats, display only 3 digits after the
decimal point for those result.

Your function should print information such as this to the console:

count: 50
unique count: 38
min: 14
max: 100
mean: 60.800
std dev: 25.283
modes: [87, 52, 70]
25th percentile: 39.750
median: 63.500
75th percentile: 86.000
